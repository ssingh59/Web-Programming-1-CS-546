  <h1>That Time when I got angry and went for shopping.</h1>

  <main>
    
        <p> One day I had a fight with my Mother on something. I went to shopping in a mall.</p>
        <p> I realised that shopping actually helps me relive my stress and relaxes my mind.<br/> Now, whenever I dont feel good I go alone to pass my time and give myself some alone time.</p>
