          <h1>The Best Palindrome Checker in the World!</h1>
          <p>A palindrome is a word, number, phrase or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as "madam" or "racecar" or the number 10201. The word palindrome (pronounced ˈpa-lən-ˌdrōm) was invented in the early 1600s by the poet and playwright Ben Jonson, using Greek roots palin and dromos meaning “again” and “direction.”</p>
